A **Library Management System** built entirely with **SQL** to simulate and analyze library operations.  
It manages books, members, employees, branches, issue/return tracking, and rental incomes ‚Äî while performing **data analysis to generate valuable business insights**.

## üóÇ Key SQL Features
1Ô∏è‚É£ CRUD Operations
## Key Findings and Insights
- Create: Add new books, members, employees
- Read: Retrieve with filters, sorting, aggregation
- Update: Modify member addresses, book statuses, etc.
- Delete: Remove outdated records or issue entries

2Ô∏è‚É£ Business Queries
- Top 3 employees by books issued
- Members who issued >3 books
- Total rental income by category
- Books never issued
- Overdue books & days overdue
- Branch performance metrics
- Average salary per branch

3Ô∏è‚É£ Analytical Tables (CTAS)
- book_issued_cnt ‚Äì Times each book was issued
- expensive_books ‚Äì Books above average price
- active_members ‚Äì Members active in the last 2 months

4Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced SQL
- Window Functions: Avg salary comparison by branch
- CTEs: Employees with above-average salaries
- Date Functions: Recent issues, overdue returns, seasonal trends
- Joins: Combine tables for richer insights

### Example SQL Queries
 1Ô∏è‚É£ Top 3 employees who issued the most books
```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, COUNT(i.issue_id) AS total_issued
FROM employees e
JOIN issued_status i ON e.employee_id = i.employee_id
GROUP BY e.employee_id, e.name
ORDER BY total_issued DESC
LIMIT 3;
```
 2Ô∏è‚É£ Members who issued more than 3 books
 ```sql
SELECT m.member_id, m.name, COUNT(i.issue_id) AS books_issued
FROM members m
JOIN issued_status i ON m.member_id = i.member_id
GROUP BY m.member_id, m.name
HAVING COUNT(i.issue_id) > 3;
```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Total rental income by category
```sql
SELECT b.category, SUM(b.price) AS total_income
FROM books b
JOIN issued_status i ON b.ISBN = i.ISBN
JOIN return_status r ON i.issue_id = r.issue_id
GROUP BY b.category
ORDER BY total_income DESC; 
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Books never issued
```sql
SELECT b.ISBN, b.title
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN issued_status i ON b.ISBN = i.ISBN
WHERE i.issue_id IS NULL; 
```
