A **Library Management System** built entirely with **SQL** to simulate and analyze library operations.  
It manages books, members, employees, branches, issue/return tracking, and rental incomes ‚Äî while performing **data analysis to generate valuable business insights**.

## üóÇ Database Structure

| Table Name       | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **books**        | Details of all books (ISBN, title, category, price, availability, author, publisher) |
| **members**      | Member details including registration date and address |
| **issued_status**| Tracks book issues (issuing employee & member) |
| **return_status**| Tracks returned books and return dates |
| **employees**    | Employee details (position, salary, branch) |
| **branch**       | Library branch details, including manager info |


## üóÇ Key SQL Features
1Ô∏è‚É£ CRUD Operations

üî∏ Create: Add new books, members, employees

üî∏ Read: Retrieve with filters, sorting, aggregation

üî∏ Update: Modify member addresses, book statuses, etc.

üî∏ Delete: Remove outdated records or issue entries

2Ô∏è‚É£ Business Queries


üî∏ Top 3 employees by books issued

üî∏ Members who issued >3 books

üî∏ Total rental income by category

üî∏ Books never issued

üî∏ Overdue books & days overdue

üî∏ Branch performance metrics

üî∏ Average salary per branch

3Ô∏è‚É£ Analytical Tables (CTAS)

üî∏ book_issued_cnt ‚Äì Times each book was issued

üî∏ expensive_books ‚Äì Books above average price

üî∏ active_members ‚Äì Members active in the last 2 months

4Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced SQL

üî∏ Window Functions: Avg salary comparison by branch

üî∏ CTEs: Employees with above-average salaries

üî∏ Date Functions: Recent issues, overdue returns, seasonal trends

üî∏ Joins: Combine tables for richer insights

### Example SQL Queries
 1Ô∏è‚É£ Top 3 employees who issued the most books
```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.name, COUNT(i.issue_id) AS total_issued
FROM employees e
JOIN issued_status i ON e.employee_id = i.employee_id
GROUP BY e.employee_id, e.name
ORDER BY total_issued DESC
LIMIT 3;

 2Ô∏è‚É£ Members who issued more than 3 books
SELECT m.member_id, m.name, COUNT(i.issue_id) AS books_issued
FROM members m
JOIN issued_status i ON m.member_id = i.member_id
GROUP BY m.member_id, m.name
HAVING COUNT(i.issue_id) > 3; ```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Total rental income by category

SELECT b.category, SUM(b.price) AS total_income
FROM books b
JOIN issued_status i ON b.ISBN = i.ISBN
JOIN return_status r ON i.issue_id = r.issue_id
GROUP BY b.category
ORDER BY total_income DESC; ```

4Ô∏è‚É£ Books never issued
SELECT b.ISBN, b.title
FROM books b
LEFT JOIN issued_status i ON b.ISBN = i.ISBN
WHERE i.issue_id IS NULL; ```
